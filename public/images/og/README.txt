The nextstage-og.png file should be created as a 500x500 PNG with:
- White (#FFFFFF) background
- NextStage logo-mark-gradient.svg centered
- Sufficient padding around the logo (at least 100px on each side)

This follows the clean, minimal approach seen in services like Meta Deck where the preview shows just the logo mark on a clean background.
